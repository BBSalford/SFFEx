What is the present market 

Commercial farming operations; large scale equipment deisned for high productivity/capacity;
multiple pieces of equipment depending on operation (tillage, seeding, harvesting, material handling, irrigating
fertilizing, insecticide/herbicide application)
Majority of North American and Western European farms still privately held sole proprietor or partnerships with family members making up
management team; rapidly moving toward corporate entities
Eastern European and Russian farms corporate;

Complex variety of practices taking into consideration soil conservation, nutrient inputs, pest and weed management
water management, biomass management

Heavy experientation in nutrient management with maturity of field mapping technology over last 20 years; seeding, nutrient
application and pesticide/herbidcide application equipment using data collected during harvest and soil sampling to vary
application rates in operation.  Increasing push towards drones for collecting field data for this use.

Latest generation of farmers more tecnologically savy, better business training; most with degrees in agriscience.
Data centric business management practices; utilization of available technology to monitor business activity.

Scale and cost of equipment driving up farm capital costs at a non-linear rate.  Large operations favour turning over large
equipment assest every 3-4 years to avoid down-time risks; has resulted in influx of large, expensive used equipment with
limited market; happens in cyclical patten every 5-10 years;  Dealers slow purchase of new equipment during these down cycles
slowing product development as manufacturers cut costs to ride things out
